# Stack Implementation

Stack is based upon the LIFO (last in first out) principal. Below are the functions you are expected to write in the implementation:

- push(): Insert an element a the last.
- pop(): Delete the element for the last
- isEmpty(): determines whether the stack is empty or not.
- isFull(): determines whether the stack is full or not.'
- peek(): returns the element at the given position.
- count(): returns the total number of elements available in a stack.
- change(): changes the element at the given position.
- display(): prints all the elements available in the stack.
